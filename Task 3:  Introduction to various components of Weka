COMPONENTS OF WEKA:-WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) is a powerful and widely used open-source data mining and machine learning tool developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. It provides a graphical interface and supports several machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks such as data preprocessing, classification, regression, clustering, and visualization.
As shown in the  below image, five options are available in the Applications category.
The Explorer is the central panel where most data mining tasks are performed. 
The tool provides an Experimenter In this panel, we can run experiments and also design them.
WEKA provides the KnowledgeFlow panel. It provides an interface to drag and drop components, connect them to form a knowledge flow, and analyze the data and results.
The Simple CLI panel provides the command line powers to run WEKA. 


Main Components of WEKA
Here are the core components (interfaces) of WEKA:
1. Explorer
Most widely used interface in WEKA.


Provides a GUI for easy access to all major functionalities.


Main Tabs in Explorer:


Preprocess – Load and preprocess data (e.g., remove attributes, normalize, discretize).


Classify – Apply classification and regression algorithms.


Cluster – Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, EM).


Associate – Discover association rules (e.g., Apriori).


Select attributes – Perform feature selection.


Visualize – View data and results graphically.


2. Experimenter
Allows systematic comparison of different learning algorithms.


Can be used to run experiments in batch mode and analyze the results statistically.


Supports cross-validation and statistical significance testing.


3. Knowledge Flow
Provides a visual programming interface.


Allows users to design and execute data mining pipelines (like KNIME or Orange).


Similar to Explorer but with a drag-and-drop workflow design.



4. Simple CLI (Command Line Interface)
Offers command-line access to WEKA's functionalities.


Useful for scripting and automation of tasks without GUI.



5. Package Manager
Lets users install and manage additional WEKA packages and plugins.


Extends the functionality with newer algorithms, visualization tools, and scripting interfaces.


6. Weka Server
A component for running WEKA processes in a client-server environment.


Useful for scaling up experiments or integrating with larger systems.
