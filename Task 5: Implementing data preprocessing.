I) Implementing data preprocessing:

Step 1: Launch Weka
Open the Weka application.
In the main menu, click on "Explorer" to start the data exploration and preprocessing interface.

Step 2: Load Dataset
Click the "Open file" button on the top-left corner.
Navigate to your dataset file (in .arff, .csv, or other supported formats) and open it.

Step 3: Inspect Data
Review the dataset details in the "Preprocess" tab:
Attributes (columns of the dataset) are listed on the left.
A histogram and basic statistics for the selected attribute are displayed on the right.
Check the number of instances (rows), attributes, and missing values.

Step 4: Filter Data
Weka provides filters to preprocess the data. Filters can be categorized into:
Unsupervised (e.g., handling missing values, normalization).
Supervised (e.g., discretization based on class labels).
4.1: Apply a Filter
Select a filter from the "Choose" button in the filter section.
For missing values: Unsupervised > Attribute > ReplaceMissingValues.
For normalization: Unsupervised > Attribute > Normalize.
For removing attributes: Unsupervised > Attribute > Remove.
Configure the filter:
Click on the filter name once selected, and a configuration box will appear.
Set any necessary parameters (e.g., which attribute to normalize).
Click the "Apply" button to apply the filter.



Association rule mining:- in Weka is performed using the "Associate" panel. This functionality is used to find relationships between items in a dataset, typically in a transaction database. Weka includes popular algorithms like Apriori and FPGrowth for this purpose.
Here’s a step-by-step guide to performing association rule mining in Weka:
Step 1: Navigate to the Associate Panel
After loading the dataset, click on the "Associate" tab at the top of the Explorer.
This panel is specifically designed for generating association rules.



Step 2: Select an Algorithm
Click the "Choose" button to select an association rule mining algorithm.
Apriori: A classic algorithm for association rule mining.
FPGrowth: An alternative algorithm that is faster for large datasets.
After selecting the algorithm, you can click on it to configure its parameters.
